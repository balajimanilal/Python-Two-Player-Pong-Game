# Python-Two-Player-Pong-Game
Welcome to the Pong Game! This is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. Players control paddles to hit a bouncing ball and score points. The first player to reach a designated score wins the game.

# Game Mechanics
- The ball will bounce off the top and bottom walls.
- Players can move their paddles up and down to hit the ball.
- If a player fails to hit the ball, the other player scores a point.
- The game continues until you manually exit.
